# STM32F429ZI Project

## Overview
This project focuses on implementing an Ethernet driver for the STM32F429ZI. To achieve this, we need to set up several components, including the clock (timebase), GPIO driver, UART driver, and ADC driver.

## Components

### 1. Clock Setup
- **Timebase**: The initial step is to configure the system clock to provide accurate timing for the entire system.

### 2. GPIO Driver
- **Purpose**: To monitor and control the pins on the microcontroller.
- **Usage**: Check our timebase by toggling GPIO pins.

### 3. UART Driver
- **Purpose**: To facilitate communication between the STM32F429ZI and a PC.
- **Tools Required**: Use RealTerm software to capture and view the UART output on your PC.
- **Implementation**:
  - We override `int __io_putchar(int ch)` to redirect the `printf` output to the UART.
  - **Note**: The `printf` function internally uses `__io_putchar`.

### 4. ADC Driver
- **Purpose**: To read values from sensors.
- **Usage**: The ADC driver will read sensor values and send these values using our Ethernet driver to the server.

### 5. Ethernet Driver
- **Focus**: The primary focus of this project is to establish Ethernet communication.
- **Pre-requisites**: Ensure the clock, GPIO, UART, and ADC drivers are configured correctly before proceeding.

## Usage
1. **Clock Configuration**: Set up the system clock to provide a stable timebase.
2. **GPIO Driver**: Configure GPIO pins for monitoring the timebase.
3. **UART Driver**:
   - Install RealTerm or any terminal software to capture UART output.
   - Use `printf` to send data over UART, which will be visible on RealTerm.
4. **ADC Driver**: Read sensor values using the ADC driver.
5. **Ethernet Driver**: Send the read sensor values to the server using the Ethernet driver.

## Additional Notes
- Ensure all drivers are correctly initialized and configured before starting the Ethernet communication.
- The `__io_putchar` function is crucial for redirecting `printf` output to the UART. Properly overriding this function ensures that `printf` works as expected with the UART driver.
